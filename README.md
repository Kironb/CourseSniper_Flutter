# CourseSniper_Flutter

A new Rutgers Course Sniper Flutter project.
Meant to be an Android port for [Kirtan's](https://github.com/kirtanp98) Course Sniper Project.
Will likely use [Arjun's Firebase Backend](https://github.com/sriRacha21/rct-backend).

Could potentially be ported to web and desktop via Flutter.
